# Derivative-of-a-Function-14.2
Use MATLAB to find the graph of the derivative of the function:
𝑓(𝑥) = 5𝑥^2*e^−0.2xsin(𝑥)
Set up an x-array from 0 to 10 with an increment of 0.01 
Calculate the y-array that matches that x-array
Find the central difference estimate of the derivative
Plot the original function and the derivative on two separate graphs
